This directory is a stub meant to mimic a local-client project created
from a caCORE SDK. yacaqueryservice targets such a client to build CXF
web services. Once you have configured and built a caCORE SDK project,
the local-client project can be found in the following directory.

project/target/dist/exploded/output/*projectname*/package/local-client
